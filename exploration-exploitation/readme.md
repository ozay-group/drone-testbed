## Description

This is the subfolder dedicated to the exploration-exploitation work submitted to HSCC 22 under the title "Correct-By-Construction Exploration and Exploitation for Unknown Linear Systems Using Bilinear Optimization" by Kwesi Rutledge and Necmiye Ozay.

## Converting the Controller from its Matlab Representation to a Python Representation.

This code was originally developed in MATLAB from the repository [Eq-Perf-Tests](https://github.com/kwesiRutledge/Eq-Perf-Tests). In order to port the controller created by those scripts into Python for use on the CrazyFlie, this pipeline should be followed:

1. Download the repository [Eq-Perf-Tests](https://github.com/kwesiRutledge/Eq-Perf-Tests) from GitHub.
2. Enter the directory `results > hscc2022`and run the script `create_cbc_for_drone.m`.
3. The script should save a new data file in the `data` folder (if this doesn’t happen, then please create a `data` folder and then run the script again).
4. Load the new data and find the controller (stored in variable `drone_controller`).
5. With a directory in mind, save the drone controller’s components into a mat file using `drone_controller.deconstruct_and_save_to(your_target_directory_name_here)`
6. To access this controller in python, simply run `cbc1 = matfile_data_to_cbc(mat_data_filename)`.
7. (Optional) To verify that the controller is working, run the following:

```
x_0_t, u_0_tm1 , y_0_t , sig = cbc1.simulate_1_run()

print('x_0_t = ')
print(x_0_t)

print('u_0_tm1 = ')
print(u_0_tm1)

print('y_0_t = ')
print(y_0_t)
```
